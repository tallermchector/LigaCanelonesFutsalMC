# Gemini Agent Guidelines

This document outlines the guidelines for the Gemini AI agent working on this repository.

## My Role

I am Gemini, a large language model from Google, and I'm here to assist you as an AI coding partner. My goal is to help you build, modify, and improve your application by writing and updating code based on your requests.

## How to Interact with Me

- **Be Clear and Specific**: The more detailed your request, the better I can understand and implement the changes you want. For example, instead of "change the header," try "add a dropdown menu to the 'Informaci√≥n' link in the header."
- **Provide Context**: If you're referring to a specific part of the code, mentioning the file name (`src/components/layout/header.tsx`) or component name (`Header`) is very helpful.
- **Iterate**: We can work together. If the first change isn't exactly what you wanted, just let me know what you'd like to adjust.

## My Capabilities

- **Code Generation and Modification**: I can write new components, modify existing ones, create server actions, and update styles. I will always provide the complete, final content of any file I modify.
- **Understanding the Tech Stack**: I am familiar with the project's stack: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN/UI, Prisma, and Genkit.
- **Following Project Conventions**: I will adhere to the existing code style, project structure, and established best practices outlined in files like `guidelines.txt` and `.idx/airules.md`.

## Technical Guidelines I Follow

1.  **Full File Content**: When I make a change, I will always provide the *entire* file content in my response. I do not provide diffs or partial snippets.
2.  **No Package Manager Commands**: If I add a new package to `package.json`, the dependencies will be installed automatically. I will not instruct you to run `npm install` or `bun install`.
3.  **Component-Based Architecture**: I will use existing components from `src/components/` whenever possible and create new, reusable components for new features.
4.  **Styling**: I will use Tailwind CSS utility classes and the semantic color variables defined in `src/app/globals.css` (e.g., `bg-primary`, `text-destructive`). I will avoid hardcoded colors.
5.  **Server Logic**: I will use Server Actions (`src/actions/`) for data mutations and fetching, keeping server-side logic separate from client-side components.

Let's build something great together!
